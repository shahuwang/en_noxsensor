If you are viewing this page, you are interested in our products! Whatever your questions, concerns, or needs, please **immediately send an email to fortisor@163.com**. You may write the email in your native language, and we will reply to you as quickly as possible.

As you can see, our website does not display product prices or offer a direct online ordering function. This approach is based on the following reasons, which ultimately benefit our customers:

* **1. Product Diversity and User Experience:** NOx sensors come in a vast variety of models and specifications. Listing every single model and spec for direct ordering would make the website overwhelmingly complex, resulting in a poor user experience.
* **2. Global Supply Complexity:** We supply our products worldwide, and different countries have significant variations in tariffs, taxes, shipping costs, and customs regulations. Direct online pricing cannot accurately account for these differences.
* **3. High Transaction Costs:** Online payment services for direct customer orders typically charge a minimum of 3% per transaction. As our products are mainly for large-volume, business-to-business (B2B) procurement, this 3% fee would substantially increase your overall sourcing cost.
* **4. Protecting Customer Profit Margins:** Making our wholesale prices transparent could negatively impact our distributors and partners. They need sufficient profit margins when reselling our products, and price transparency would compress their pricing space.
* **5. Building Long-Term Partnerships:** We aim to establish long-term, stable cooperation, not just single, one-off transactions. We prefer to communicate via email to understand your specific needs, allowing us to provide better tailored products and superior service.

**Therefore, please contact us directly via email.** We will provide you with the most suitable product recommendations and a precise quotation tailored to your requirements.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

We have summarized the following common questions regarding customer procurement needs and concerns:

### **1. What is the quality and warranty of your products?**

Our **NOx Sensors** use sensing probes from the **NGK Company**, which offers industry-leading sensing stability. This effectively prevents sensing inaccuracies caused by signal drift. Furthermore, our ECUs utilize **automotive-grade chips**. The quality of both the probe and the chip are superior to many common aftermarket NOx sensors on the market.

* **Warranty:** We provide a **15-month warranty** for our **NOx Sensors** to our distributors. Our **AdBlue Pump / Urea Dosing Module** products carry a **12-month warranty**.

### **2. What is your product pricing like? Can you offer discounts?**

Our prices are significantly **lower than OEM/Original** parts but are slightly higher than some low-quality aftermarket NOx sensors. We do not use low prices to attract customers because establishing a stable automotive parts business is challenging. Once established, a quality-based partnership leads to long-term, win-win cooperation, which low-quality products cannot guarantee.

Our prices being much lower than OEM parts does not mean the quality is significantly inferior. OEM parts are more expensive primarily due to:

* **High Yield Rate Costs:** Achieving ultra-high yield rates (e.g., 99.99% vs. 99.9%) requires massive R&D and testing investment, reflected in the price.
* **Brand Premium:** A significant portion of the cost is for brand value, which does not impact the actual quality or performance.
* **Long-Term Stocking:** OEMs must stock parts for many years of after-sales service, and the associated capital and management costs are built into the price.
* **Vehicle Cost Subsidies:** OEMs often use accessories to generate higher profits, which can subsidize the cost of the complete vehicle.

**Discount Policy:** We encourage customers to order a **sample first**, then proceed with a **small batch order**, and gradually increase the volume as the cooperation stabilizes. We offer a **tiered discount policy** based on purchasing volume; the larger the order, the greater the discount.

### **3. What is your lead time for delivery?**

For orders up to **100 units**, we can generally ship within **48 hours**. For larger orders exceeding 100 units, we will provide a specific delivery time based on the circumstances, but it typically **will not exceed 3‚Äì5 days**.

### **4. What are your shipping methods and costs?**

We typically use international express services such as **DHL, FedEx, and UPS**. Shipping costs vary depending on the destination country and region, but delivery can generally be made to most countries worldwide within **10 days**. The shipping cost will be quoted alongside the product price.

### **5. Which payment methods do you accept?**

We will try our best to provide a **local bank account** in your country to save you international transfer fees. If this is not possible, we can accept cross-border transfers to our **Hong Kong bank account** or provide you with a secure **online credit card payment link** (powered by Alibaba payment services).

### **6. Can you provide invoices and assist with customs?**

We can provide a formal invoice. The **HS Code** and declared **Customs Value** can be adjusted according to your requirements to help reduce taxes or meet specific customs restrictions in your country.

### **7. Do you offer OEM/ODM services?**

Yes, we offer **OEM/ODM services** based on customer needs. This includes, but is not limited to: customizing the **logo and brand name** on the NOx product surface, as well as **custom packaging boxes**. Please contact us via email to discuss your specific customization requirements.
